# Contributing to OSRD

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,
enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

Check out our community's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and feel free to say hi on our [#public-general:osrd.fr](https://matrix.to/#/#public-general:osrd.fr)
matrix channel if you'd like. It's a nice place to chat about OSRD development,
ask questions, and get to know the other contributors and users in a less formal
setting. If you are not sure about what to do, have a look at currently open
[good first issues](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Getting oriented

The OSRD project has 2 primary repos:

1. [`osrd`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd): This is where the
simulator is developed.
2. [`osrd-website`](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd-website): Where
the [`official website`](https://osrd.fr), blog, documentation, ... are hosted.

This is the ui repo. For more information on the project and how to contribute
to it checkout the [Contributing](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file of the main repo.
